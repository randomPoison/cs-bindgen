    <strong>Facilitating high-level interactions between Rust and C#.</strong>

## Example

Declare functions in Rust and expose them to C#.

```rust
#[cs_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

Call into Rust code from C# as if it were idiomatic C#!

```cs
var greeting = Example.Greet("Ferris");

// Prints "Hello, Ferris!"
Console.WriteLine(greeting);
```

> NOTE: Above example not yet fully supported. Notably, it's not yet possible to pass a string from C# to Rust (though returning one from Rust to C# work fine).

## Status

Highly experimental! Do not use, even as a joke!

## Running Integration Tests

In addition to the usual Rust testing setup that can be run via `cargo run`, there's a more complete integration test setup that builds C# bindings into a .NET Core project and uses [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) to test that the Rust binary can be embedded correctly. To setup the bindings for the tests, first run:

```
cargo run -p builder
```

Then, to run the tests, navigate to the `integration-tests/TestRunner` directory and run:

```
dotnet test
```
